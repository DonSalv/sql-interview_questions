Summary of observations by exercises:

Observations. Remarks you need to attend for the exercise to behave correctly.
Pass: The sign ✅ means the query pass the test and ⛔ means the query fail the test. In case of failure
      the corresponding test where the query fails is showed.

Performance: A scale with the quality of the solution
    - Top: The query is optimal.
    - High: The query performs over the mean.
    - Standard: The query can be optimized.
    - Low: The query needs a review to improve
